        Initialize cipher object, suitable for encryption/decryption.

        Running decrypt() operation after encrypt() or vice versa is not supported.

        Parameters are:

            key is an encryption/decryption key (bytes-like).
            mode is:

                1 (or ucryptolib.MODE_ECB if it exists) for Electronic Code Book (ECB).
                2 (or ucryptolib.MODE_CBC if it exists) for Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
                6 (or ucryptolib.MODE_CTR if it exists) for Counter mode (CTR).

            IV is an initialization vector for CBC mode.
            For Counter mode, IV is the initial value for the counter.

"""ubluetooth â€” low-level Bluetooth

This module provides an interface to a Bluetooth controller on a board. Currently this supports
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in Central, Peripheral, Broadcaster, and Observer roles, and a device may operate in multiple
roles concurrently.
This API is intended to match the low-level Bluetooth protocol and provide building-blocks for higher-level abstractions
such as specific device types.

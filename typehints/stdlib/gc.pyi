"""gc â€“ control the garbage collector

This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below.
For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: gc.

def threshold(amount: int) -> int:

    Set or query the additional GC allocation threshold.
    Normally, a collection is triggered only when a new allocation cannot be satisfied, i.e. on an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.
    If this function is called, in addition to OOM, a collection will be triggered each time after amount bytes
    have been allocated (in total, since the previous time such an amount of bytes have been allocated).

    amount is usually specified as less than the full heap size, with the intention to trigger a collection earlier
    than when the heap becomes exhausted, and in the hope that an early collection will prevent excessive memory fragmentation.
    This is a heuristic measure, the effect of which will vary from application to application,
    as well as the optimal value of the amount parameter.
    Calling the function without argument will return the current value of the threshold.

    A value of -1 means a disabled allocation threshold.

    :param amount: Amount of bytes.
    :type amount: int
    :return: Optimal value of the amount parameter.

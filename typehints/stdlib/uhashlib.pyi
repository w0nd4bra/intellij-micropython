"""uhashlib â€“ hashing algorithms

This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below.
For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: hashlib.

This module implements binary data hashing algorithms. The exact inventory of available algorithms depends on a board.
Among the algorithms which may be implemented:

SHA256 - The current generation, modern hashing algorithm (of SHA2 series).
    It is suitable for cryptographically-secure purposes.
    Included in the MicroPython core and any board is recommended to provide this, unless it has particular code size constraints.

SHA1 - A previous generation algorithm.
    Not recommended for new usages, but SHA1 is a part of number of Internet standards and existing applications, so boards targeting network connectivity and interoperability will try to provide this.

MD5 - A legacy algorithm, not considered cryptographically secure.
    Only selected boards, targeting interoperability with legacy applications, will offer this.
